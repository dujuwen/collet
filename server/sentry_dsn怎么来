sentry_dsn怎么来?
登录sentry之后新建laravel项目可以得到.

This is a quick getting started guide. For in-depth instructions on integrating Sentry with Laravel, view our complete documentation.

Installation
There are various ways to install the PHP integration for Sentry. The recommended way is to use Composer:

$ composer require "sentry/sentry"
Alternatively you can manually install it:

Download and extract the latest sentry-php archive to your PHP project.

Require the autoloader in your application:

require_once '/path/to/Raven/library/Raven/Autoloader.php';
Raven_Autoloader::register();
Laravel 5.x
Install the sentry/sentry-laravel package:

$ composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
If you’re on Laravel 5.4 or earlier, you’ll need to add the following to your config/app.php (for Laravel 5.5+ these will be auto-discovered by Laravel):

'providers' => array(
    // ...
    Sentry\SentryLaravel\SentryLaravelServiceProvider::class,
)

'aliases' => array(
    // ...
    'Sentry' => Sentry\SentryLaravel\SentryFacade::class,
)
Add Sentry reporting to App/Exceptions/Handler.php:

public function report(Exception $exception)
{
    if (app()->bound('sentry') && $this->shouldReport($exception)) {
        app('sentry')->captureException($exception);
    }

    parent::report($exception);
}
Create the Sentry configuration file (config/sentry.php):

$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Sentry\SentryLaravel\SentryLaravelServiceProvider"
Add your DSN to .env:

SENTRY_DSN=********  //这里就是了

Finally, if you wish to wire up User Feedback, you can do so by creating a custom error view in resources/views/errors/500.blade.php.
