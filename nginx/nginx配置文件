nginx consists of modules which are controlled by directives specified in the configuration file. 
Directives are divided into simple directives and block directives.
A simple directive consists of the name and parameters separated by spaces and ends with a semicolon (;).
A block directive has the same structure as a simple directive, but instead of the semicolon it ends with a set of additional
instructions surrounded by braces ({ and }). If a block directive can have other directives inside braces,
it is called a context (examples: events, http, server, and location).

Directives placed in the configuration file outside of any contexts are considered to be in the main context.
The events and http directives reside in the main context, server in http, and location in server.
The rest of a line after the # sign is considered a comment.

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name loc.nginx.t;

    location / {
        root  /Users/dujunwen/Desktop/test/data;
        index test.html;
    }

    location /images/ {
        root  /Users/dujunwen/Desktop/test/data;
    }
}

If there are several matching location blocks nginx selects the one with the longest prefix.
nginx在多个location都匹配的时候选择的是最长路径匹配location

在将目录权限改大后还是出现403的话可以修改 user 用户 用户组，用户和组跟 location root下目录对应的用户和组一致即可
