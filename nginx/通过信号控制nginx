1.通过kill发送信号
http://nginx.org/en/docs/control.html

nginx can be controlled with signals. 
The process ID of the master process is written to the file /usr/local/nginx/logs/nginx.pid by default.
This name may be changed at configuration time, or in nginx.conf using the pid directive. 
The master process supports the following signals:

TERM, INT	fast shutdown
QUIT	graceful shutdown
HUP	changing configuration, keeping up with a changed time zone (only for FreeBSD and Linux),
    starting new worker processes with a new configuration, graceful shutdown of old worker processes
USR1	re-opening log files
USR2	upgrading an executable file
WINCH	graceful shutdown of worker processes

例如：
kill -HUP nginx_master_pid 可以优雅的读取配置后重启子进程

2.通过nginx -s发送信号
http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html

Starting, Stopping, and Reloading Configuration
To start nginx, run the executable file. Once nginx is started, it can be controlled by invoking the executable with the -s parameter. 
Use the following syntax:
nginx -s signal
Where signal may be one of the following:

stop — fast shutdown
quit — graceful shutdown
reload — reloading the configuration file
reopen — reopening the log files
