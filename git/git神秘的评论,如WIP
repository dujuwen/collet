Are you new to Github and/or contributing to open source projects? Have you seen short messages like LGTM, ACK, NACK, etc. and wondered what they mean?

Here you go:

LGTM — looks good to me
ACK — acknowledgement, i.e. agreed/accepted change
NACK/NAK —negative acknowledgement, i.e. disagree with change and/or concept
RFC — request for comments, i.e. I think this is a good idea, lets discuss
WIP — work in progress, do not merge yet
AFAIK/AFAICT — as far as I know / can tell
IIRC — if I recall correctly
IANAL — “I am not a lawyer”, but I smell licensing issues


Many projects in the crypto space also use the following (popularised by Bitcoin’s hacker lingo):

Concept ACK — agree with the concept, but haven’t reviewed the changes
utACK (aka. Untested ACK) — agree with the changes and reviewed them, but didn’t test
Tested ACK — agree with the changes, reviewed and tested
These answers are usually part of the code review process and you would find them in issues or pull requests in Github.
